New Route designs
=================


/competitions -> List of competitions from past, present and future =>  [R -> all users], [CUD -> admin only]

/competitions/{competition_id} -> Yields full timetable and other data for specified competiton => [R -> all users], [CUD -> admin only]

/competitions/{competition_id}/races/{race_id} -> Yield's specific race details => [R -> all users], [CUD -> admin only]



TO-DO
=====
[x] Create the routes based on this new plan
[x] Modify database to fit this new structure
[] Implement the access control by only allowing admins to CUD
[x] Separate the endpoints into routes (grouping them accordingly) and connect all with API Router for better organization => {competitions.py, races.py, account.py}
[] Figure out how to remove firebase realtime database from test mode so all can access forever
